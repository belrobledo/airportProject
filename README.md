your local machine for development and testing purposes. You must have npm and Docker installed in your computer.

Step by step instructions:

1- Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/belrobledo/airportProject.git

2- Run the following command in the terminal

    docker-compose up --build

3- You will now be able to access it at localhost:3000

## OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol

This project implements an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.

### OAuth 2.0 Flow
1. The user fills the login form with his credentials (email and password) and clicks the "Login" button on the login page.  
2. The client sends an authentication request to the server.  
3. The server authenticates the user and generate a pair of tokens (Access token and Refresh token). Token's value is a uuid random string. Access token has an expiration time of 15 minutes. Refresh tokens has an expiration time of 6 hours.
4. The server stores the tokens in Redis Database, along with the user's ID and user's Role. Finally, the server sends the tokens to the Client as HTTP Cookies.  
5. The client can then use the access token to authorizate and make requests to protected resources. If Access token has expired, the client can use the Refresh token to obtain a new pair of tokens. If Refresh token has also expired, the client must authenticate again with his login credentials.
